# How it Works

The meeting proposer will choose the range in which the meeting will be scheduled. He will also choose which calendars he wants to give MeetMe access to. Then, MeetMe will give you the Meeting ID and the URL for meeting participants.

Meeting participants can go to the URL given to the meeting proposer to add their availability in the same way as the meeting proposer.

Once all meeting participants have added their availability, the meeting proposer can finalize the meeting by clicking the 'Finalize' button on the home page. The meeting proposer also has the option of deleting the meeting information from the MeetMe application.
